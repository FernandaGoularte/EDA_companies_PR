# Exploratory Data Analysis of the companies of Parana (Brazil).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights from a dataset containing registration data of active companies in the state of Paraná, Brazil. This data, sourced from Receita Federal, includes key information such as company creation dates, address details, and business activity. The insights gained will support the development of a new B2B product targeted at businesses in Paraná.

## Data Challenges:
The dataset has been arbitrarily processed, resulting in some columns having inconsistent data formats. Cleaning and preprocessing are necessary for accurate analysis.

## Project Approach:
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Standardize date formats, ensuring consistency for time-based analyses.
Normalize address information, resolving any inconsistencies in city names, zip codes, etc.
Ensure business activity codes or names are categorized uniformly.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Geographical Distribution: Visualize the geographical distribution of companies across Paraná, highlighting areas with high business density.
* Business Activity Breakdown: Identify the most common business sectors, and analyze trends in specific industries (e.g., retail, services).
* Temporal Trends: Analyze company creation over time, identifying periods of growth or decline in business registrations.

### Visualization & Reporting:

Use visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create clear, insightful graphs and charts.

## Future Development:

Explore the potential integration of additional data sources (e.g., economic indicators, demographic data) to enhance the analysis.
Develop predictive models to forecast business trends and identify potential high-growth sectors.
